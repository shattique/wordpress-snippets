## WordPress Post Loop with Password Protection
This code snippet manages the display of posts while handling password protection in WordPress.

### How It Works:
Check for Posts: The loop starts by verifying if there are posts to display using have_posts().
Iterate Through Posts: If posts are found, it enters a while loop to process each post sequentially.
Password Protection Check: Inside the loop, it checks if the current post requires a password by using post_password_required().
Display Password Form: If the post is password-protected, it calls get_the_password_form() to show a form for the user to enter the password.
Display Content: If the post is accessible (i.e., the correct password has been entered), it outputs the post content with the_content().

# Usage:
This code should be included in a template file (such as single.php or index.php) to ensure that users must enter a password to access protected content. It provides a seamless user experience while maintaining content security for posts that require authentication.
